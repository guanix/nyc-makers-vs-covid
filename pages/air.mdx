# Airborne transmission

Airborne transmission is one of the main ways you can get Covid-19. Airborne transmission refers to transmission of viruses through aerosols exhaled by infected people. Aerosols can linger in the air for tens of seconds to hours, and can travel long distances.

Although scientists and public health experts disagree on the relative importance of the different routes of transmission, there is a growing body of evidence that airborne transmission is the main transmission route of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The best resource for information about airborne Covid transmission is the [FAQs on Protecting Yourself from COVID-19 Aerosol Transmission](https://tinyurl.com/FAQ-aerosols) compiled by Linsey Marr, Kimberly Prather and colleagues. On this page we have gathered resources and links from NYC Makes PPE volunteers on how to understand and reduce airborne transmission.

## Masks

Masks are good at filtering aerosols and reduce the risk of aerosol transmission.

Consider:
- Switching to a better mask, such as a nonwoven surgical-style procedure mask, or even better, a N95 or KN95 mask if they are available to you.
- [Wearing two masks](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/health/coronavirus-masks-transmission.html), for example a nonwoven surgical-style mask plus a cloth mask.
- Improving the fit of your mask with a mask fitter.

Some masks filter well but have gaps that allow aerosols to circumvent the mask, especially around the nose and cheeks. A [mask fitter](https://making.engr.wisc.edu/mask-fitter/) (also known as a mask brace) is worn on top of the mask and helps ensure a better fit, especially around the nose and cheeks. Mask fitters have the added benefit of reducing fogging of glasses.

## Ventilation

Ventilation is crucial for reducing the risk of airborne transmission inside buildings. If the building’s ventilation system does not provide adequate ventilation, opening a window, or adding a window fan, can help a lot.

**Opening a cracked window wider** can dramatically increase the amount of ventilation to the room. In the winter, opening a window works even without a breeze, because the colder denser outside air flows into a warmer room.

During the winter, it may be too cold to have windows open all the time. Consider **regularly opening windows** for a short period of time to air out the room.

If you must have a visitor in your home, CDC recommends [opening doors and windows and running fans during the visit and one hour after](https://twitter.com/cdcgov/status/1349388007363796994). We recommend also doing this before the visit to reduce the risk of the visitor being infected in case a member of your household should be infectious.

**Humidifying indoor spaces** can also help reduce the risk of transmission. There is evidence that transmission risk is greater in very humid and very dry indoor places. Try to maintain a relative humidity of at least 40%.

### Measuring ventilation

An anemometer, or wind speed meter, is a useful instrument for measuring the air flow coming from a window, air purifier or ventilation vent. Consumer-grade anemometers are available for less than $50.

By measuring the air speed of the air coming through a window, as well as measuring the size of the window opening and the volume of the room, you can calculate the number of times the air in the room is changed per hour, known as air changes per hour, or ACH. [Recommendations for ACH](https://www.lakeair.com/air-changes-per-hour/) vary by the type of venue.

Unfortunately we are not aware of recommendations specific to the Covid-19 pandemic. To provide some context, 5 ACH is barely adequate ventilation for most public spaces and probably too low during a pandemic, while we would consider 30 ACH quite impressive. The minimum “correct” level is probably somewhere in that range.

### CO₂ sensors

Measuring the level of carbon dioxide (CO₂) can provide an indication of whether an indoor space has sufficient ventilation, in light of the number of people using the space and their activity level. CO₂ is introduced to an indoor space by humans exhaling, and it is displaced by ventilation.

Outdoor CO₂ levels are around 400 parts per million (ppm). In indoor spaces, keeping CO₂ below 800 ppm is preferred, and below 600 ppm is ideal. In some crowded spaces, such as classrooms, 800 ppm is not realistic; some school systems around the world use a limit of 1,000 or 1,200 ppm.

There are CO₂ sensors for consumer use that cost less than $100. With a low-cost sensor, look for an instrument based on the principle of non-dispersive infrared sensing (NDIR). Some CO₂ sensors require calibration, so be sure to read the manual for calibration instructions. Calibration typically involves exposing the sensor to outside air, with a known 400 ppm CO₂ concentration.

Instruments that instead measure volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or “equivalent CO₂” (eCO₂) are *not* recommended as a substitute for CO₂ sensors.

## Air purifiers

### HEPA/MERV filtering

There are many air purifiers available for consumer use that are based on HEPA filters. Most of the ones [recommended by Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-purifier/) cost between $150 and $300.

HEPA filters are tested for particles around 0.3 micron in size, but will also filter particles smaller and larger than this. The current best guess is that most infectious aerosols are a few micron in size, which is well filtered by HEPA filter. The effectiveness of HEPA filters is increased by the fact that air can flow through the air purifier repeatedly.

There are also improvised designs for air purifiers, as a readily available alternative to expensive commercial air purifiers. They are generally based on 20-inch square box fans, available for $30-40, and 20×20 inch HEPA or MERV filters in cardboard frame form. Here are two such designs by the company Tex-Air Filters, :

![Images of Tex-Air Filters improvised air purifiers](/img/air-box-fan.jpg)

This shows a simple design with a single cardboard-framed filter, as well as a “Corsi” box where five filters form a cube around the box fan. We are aware of at least one commercially available box fan that has a built-in compartment for a 20×20×1 inch filter.

Note the fan shroud with the round opening in the photo on the right. A fan shroud is recommended because a box fan will otherwise have [reverse air flow in the corners](https://www.texairfilters.com/how-to-improve-the-efficiency-of-the-box-fan-and-merv-13-filter-air-cleaner/), which could cause unfiltered air to be recirculated. For the same reason, sealing up all the cracks between filters and fan with duct tape is recommended.

Cardboard-framed HEPA and MERV filters are typically plated with common depths of 1, 2 or 4 inches. In general, deeper filters contain the same filter material, but the additional pleating in a deeper frame provides more surface area, which allows for more air flow.

On paper, HEPA filters are more effective than MERV filters. MERV filters have a rating indicating their effectiveness. MERV 13 is probably the minimum for an improvised air purifier, though some high-quality MERV 11 filters are quite good at filtering aerosol-sized particles.

### UV-C air sanitizers

As a supplement to HEPA or MERV filters, it is also possible to directly kill virus using ultraviolet light, specifically UV-C light with wavelengths shorter than 280 nm. Again, there are commercial and improvised solutions.

**Ultraviolet light is harmful to humans**, so improvising a UV-C air sanitizer is risky and should only be done by knowledgeable persons with strict safety precautions. A UV-C air sanitizer would normally be built out of a metal enclosure that is opaque to ultraviolet light, and designed so that UV light cannot escape the enclosure, but air can flow through. NYC Makes PPE volunteers are currently researching various designs for such air sanitizers.
